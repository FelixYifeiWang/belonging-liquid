Urban Ecologist,"Indigenous Land Defenders, Japanese, Makers, Urban Foragers, Zen Gardening, Eco-conscious Consumers",,1,1,global,6,168,10,60,228,#00ABFF,3,"Belonging is cultivated through hands-on, participatory practices like citizen science bio-blitzes, community planting days, and maintaining little free libraries for seed and tool sharing. Key symbols include the Miyawaki mini-forest, the cross-sectional diagram of a soil cell, and the ""sponge city"" as an emblem of urban hydrology. Shared stories often revolve around the revitalization of a specific neglected lot into a community hub or the return of a native species like the peregrine falcon, narrating a collective victory. Practitioners feel part of the bigger picture by seeing their hyper-local actions—a planted tree, a monitored beehive—contribute to tangible, city-wide metrics of resilience: reduced urban heat, increased pollinator counts, and a rewilded skyline, connecting their labor to a measurable, shared metabolism.","What truly defines us, beyond any single practice or symbol, is a profound sense of becoming—a quiet rewilding of the urban soul. We are not just installing green infrastructure; we are learning a new language spoken by native plants, rainfall, and soil microbes. Our shared meaningful commonality is the deeply held belief that a city's highest achievement is not its GDP, but its ecological intelligence—its capacity to shelter both human and non-human life in a mutually beneficial partnership. We are about healing the false dichotomy between the metropolis and the natural world, finding awe not in pristine wilderness but in the resilient crack of a sidewalk where life erupts, and in the engineered grace of a bridge that doubles as a bat roost. This culture is unique in its optimistic, forward-looking melancholy; we grieve the losses of the Anthropocene while actively, joyfully building the ark of the next one, block by block. We are about the practical magic of making a home for the future, right here, in the neglected soils of the present."

Yet we Celts are told that we are not connected to our ancestors the lands or anything of the like, yet the Chinese are? Survival in spite of such dogmatic hatred is key to a Celt, there is a reason why it is said we cannot be psychoanalysed.

If you do human towers, you're probably in it as well. Listening to Catalan music also gets you near the culture and the spaces Catalan-first people share. Next would be partaking in food practices like calçots, but those ones are more open.","Something that is kind of unique to our culture but is shared with the Basque culture is that it takes pride of being against external authorities. Other subcultures of Spain have the same regional pride (food, dances, own vocabulary - though not quite a whole new language) but are less political. Catalan culture is political in itself because there was an erasing force and the Catalan people tried to stand against it. Partaking in Catalan culture practices can sometimes have a side of soft activism, when in other regions it could just be a normal shared practice with other people in the culture. There is a special pride - not arrogance - that comes with those practices. Then, there is another side to it that is more specific to the geographic area where Catalonia is in - the sun, the beach, the weather, the food. Those are activities that everyone partakes in, regardless of origin or language, and are accessible to everybody - it's just the daily way of life of Catalan people and those who Catalans share a physical space with. Because Barcelona is extremely touristy, everyone ends up getting a small taste of the Catalan way of life. "
