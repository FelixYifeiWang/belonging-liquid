Nobel Laureate,"An urban ecological culture fundamentally values reciprocity between the built and natural environments, which translates into a community that prioritizes functional, native green infrastructure for stormwater management, cooling, and biodiversity over purely aesthetic landscaping. This community deeply cares about equitable access to these ecological benefits, viewing green space as a essential right for health and well-being, not a luxury. These values manifest in the core traits of adaptive resilience and shared stewardship, seen in the promotion of mixed-use, walkable neighborhoods, robust active transportation networks, and participatory governance models that treat the city not as a separate entity from nature, but as a deeply integrated, socio-ecological system.","The material culture of this urban ecology is felt in the rough texture of permeable pavers underfoot, the sight of rain gardens brimming with native sedges, and the rusted Corten steel of bioswales that blend engineered function with natural aesthetic. It smells of damp soil after a storm and the sweet scent of linden trees along green corridors, and it sounds like the quiet hum of an electric bus paired with the dawn chorus of sparrows nesting in green roofs. This culture harvests its food from community garden plots and forages native berries from public parks, while its iconic images are not of stark skylines but of layered cross-sections revealing the hidden life of mycelial networks and root systems beneath the city's surface, visualizing the entire urban landscape as a living, breathing organism.","Our urban ecological culture deeply resonates with and actively borrows from Indigenous stewardship practices, learning principles of reciprocal land management and long-term intergenerational thinking. We connect with Nordic urbanism through its integration of nature into daily civic life and robust public infrastructure, and we resemble Japanese urban design in its meticulous miniaturization of nature and appreciation for the aesthetic of the weathered and functional. Furthermore, we draw strong kinship with maker and hacker cultures in our ethos of adaptive reuse, repurposing materials, and open-source design, and we align with the decentralized resilience of permaculture movements, applying its zoning and closed-loop principles to the scale of the neighborhood and city block.",1,1,3,"This culture exists primarily as a translocal network, rooted most vitally at the municipal and neighborhood scale where its principles are physically implemented and socially practiced. Its most authentic scope is the bioregional urban community, defined by a shared watershed, climate, and native ecology. However, it simultaneously operates at a global, conceptual scope as a philosophical and professional movement, connecting practitioners worldwide through shared literature, conferences, and digital platforms that exchange adaptive strategies for resilient city design, making it a globally-informed but locally-manifested culture.","Belonging is cultivated through hands-on, participatory practices like citizen science bio-blitzes, community planting days, and maintaining little free libraries for seed and tool sharing. Key symbols include the Miyawaki mini-forest, the cross-sectional diagram of a soil cell, and the ""sponge city"" as an emblem of urban hydrology. Shared stories often revolve around the revitalization of a specific neglected lot into a community hub or the return of a native species like the peregrine falcon, narrating a collective victory. Practitioners feel part of the bigger picture by seeing their hyper-local actions—a planted tree, a monitored beehive—contribute to tangible, city-wide metrics of resilience: reduced urban heat, increased pollinator counts, and a rewilded skyline, connecting their labor to a measurable, shared metabolism.","What truly defines us, beyond any single practice or symbol, is a profound sense of becoming—a quiet rewilding of the urban soul. We are not just installing green infrastructure; we are learning a new language spoken by native plants, rainfall, and soil microbes. Our shared meaningful commonality is the deeply held belief that a city's highest achievement is not its GDP, but its ecological intelligence—its capacity to shelter both human and non-human life in a mutually beneficial partnership. We are about healing the false dichotomy between the metropolis and the natural world, finding awe not in pristine wilderness but in the resilient crack of a sidewalk where life erupts, and in the engineered grace of a bridge that doubles as a bat roost. This culture is unique in its optimistic, forward-looking melancholy; we grieve the losses of the Anthropocene while actively, joyfully building the ark of the next one, block by block. We are about the practical magic of making a home for the future, right here, in the neglected soils of the present."

You can go anywhere across the globe and often find an alumni wearing the Michigan ""M"" on a hat or t-shirt. If you say ""Go Blue,"" people will almost always say it back. The ""Go Blue"" acknowledges a shared history of once being a Michigan student, sharing academic and community values.

If you do human towers, you're probably in it as well. Listening to Catalan music also gets you near the culture and the spaces Catalan-first people share. Next would be partaking in food practices like calçots, but those ones are more open.","Something that is kind of unique to our culture but is shared with the Basque culture is that it takes pride of being against external authorities. Other subcultures of Spain have the same regional pride (food, dances, own vocabulary - though not quite a whole new language) but are less political. Catalan culture is political in itself because there was an erasing force and the Catalan people tried to stand against it. Partaking in Catalan culture practices can sometimes have a side of soft activism, when in other regions it could just be a normal shared practice with other people in the culture. There is a special pride - not arrogance - that comes with those practices. Then, there is another side to it that is more specific to the geographic area where Catalonia is in - the sun, the beach, the weather, the food. Those are activities that everyone partakes in, regardless of origin or language, and are accessible to everybody - it's just the daily way of life of Catalan people and those who Catalans share a physical space with. Because Barcelona is extremely touristy, everyone ends up getting a small taste of the Catalan way of life. "
